# STAR207-Final-Project-

# Abstract
This report analyzes data from Project STAR and our goal is to evaluate if smaller class sizes lead to better math scores. For the initial report, a two-way fixed effects ANOVA model was used but it had a lot of limitations. In this report, we explore a broader set of variables, including teacher-related factors such as career level and race to examine their potential impact on student performance. Additional factors like socioeconomic status (lunch status) and school location (urban, rural, suburban, and inner-city) will be examined as well. To select the variables, we rely on initial hypotheses, domain knowledge, and variable selection methods like backward selection. We also implement a mixed-effects model, treating school ID as a random effect while including kindergarten scores for baseline differences.

# Introduction
Class size has been a topic of debate for researchers and policymakers as to whether smaller class sizes lead to better outcomes. Project STAR tracked students from kindergarten through third grade and assigned them randomly to small classes, regular classes, or regular classes with a teacher’s aide. Our analysis aims to answer these questions: Do students in smaller classes achieve higher math scores? How do socioeconomic, school location, and teacher-related factors influence student performance? In this report, we refine our approach by incorporating additional variables and adopting a mixed-effects model to address limitations from the initial analysis.

# Background 
Project STAR was a large-scale, longitudinal experiment conducted in Tennessee from 1985 to 1989 to evaluate the effects of class sizes. Students were randomly assigned to one of three classroom types: (1) small classes with 13–17 students, (2) regular classes with 22–25 students, or (3) regular classes with a teacher’s aide. The nature of the experimental design ensured that each school had at least one of each class type to reduce confounding effects. Students were expected to remain in their assigned class types, but biases occurred due to noncompliance and self-selection. Despite these issues, Project STAR has still been one of the most rigorous studies.
